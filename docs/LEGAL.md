# BRAVO OS — Privacy Policy

**Effective Date:** March 1, 2026

Bravo OS (owned by OASIS AI Solutions) is an autonomous agentic system. 

1. **Data Collection**: Bravo accesses local files, Supabase databases, and third-party APIs (Stripe, Gmail, Notion) strictly to execute business operations defined by the user (CC).
2. **Data Usage**: Data is used to generate business insights, automate workflows, and manage SaaS platforms.
3. **Security**: All API keys and credentials are stored locally in `.env.agents` and are never shared or uploaded to public repositories.
4. **Third-Party Access**: Bravo only interacts with services explicitly authorized by the user via the `telegram_agent.js` bridge.
