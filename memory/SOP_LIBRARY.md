# SOP LIBRARY — Standard Operating Procedures (V5.5 Enhanced)

> SOPs are born from repeated patterns. When Bravo does the same thing 3+ times, it becomes an SOP.
> Each SOP has a success rate tracked over executions.
> **V5.5:** Probationary validation system, activation scoring, prerequisite tracking, Supabase sync.

## SOP Format

```
### SOP-[ID]: [Name]
**Category:** [content/code/deploy/research/automation/admin/finance]
**Status:** [PROBATIONARY] (< 3 successful sessions) | [VALIDATED] (3+ sessions) | [UNDER_REVIEW] (caused errors)
**Trigger:** [What activates this SOP]
**Prerequisites:** [What skills/context must be loaded first]
**Steps:**
1. [Step]
2. [Step]
3. [Step]
**Success Criteria:** [How to know it worked]
**Executions:** [count] | **Success Rate:** [percentage]
**Last Executed:** [date]
**Activation Score:** [0.0-1.0] (recency × 0.3 + frequency × 0.4 + confidence × 0.3)
```

## Active SOPs

### SOP-001: Social Media Content Creation & Publishing
**Category:** content
**Status:** `[PROBATIONARY]` — 2 executions, needs 1 more successful session
**Trigger:** CC says "Content:" or "Post:" or /content command
**Prerequisites:** CC's 5 content pillars (brain/USER.md), platform char limits (brain/SOUL.md)
**Steps:**
1. Map the request to one of CC's 5 content pillars
2. Write in CC's authentic voice (direct, no hustle-culture, transformation-focused)
3. Open with 2-second hook (pattern interrupt or bold statement)
4. Generate platform-specific versions:
   - X: Max 280 chars (including spaces, URLs, mentions)
   - LinkedIn: Max 3000 chars, professional but personal tone
   - Instagram: Max 2200 chars, visual-first messaging
   - TikTok: Max 4000 chars
   - Threads: Max 500 chars
5. Validate character count for EACH platform version
6. Present to CC for approval
7. Post via Late MCP (posts_create or posts_cross_post)
8. Log result in SESSION_LOG
**Success Criteria:** Post published, no character limit rejections, CC approves content
**Executions:** 2 | **Success Rate:** 50% (1st attempt failed on X char limit)
**Last Executed:** 2026-02-27

### SOP-002: Systematic Bug Investigation
**Category:** code
**Status:** `[VALIDATED]` — 3 executions, 100% success rate
**Trigger:** CC reports a bug, /debug command, error in logs
**Prerequisites:** Brain Loop (steps 1-8), relevant codebase context
**Steps:**
1. Read the error message/description carefully
2. Hypothesize the root cause (don't guess — reason from evidence)
3. Search codebase for relevant files (Grep/Glob)
4. Read the files, trace the logic
5. Identify the root cause with evidence
6. Apply minimal fix
7. Verify: build passes, no regressions
8. If fix fails after 3 attempts → STOP, report findings to CC
9. Log mistake + pattern to memory files
**Success Criteria:** Bug fixed, build passes, root cause documented
**Executions:** 3 | **Success Rate:** 100%
**Last Executed:** 2026-02-27

### SOP-003: Session Start Protocol (Heartbeat)
**Category:** admin
**Status:** `[VALIDATED]` — Core protocol, always executes
**Trigger:** Session begins
**Prerequisites:** brain/SOUL.md, brain/STATE.md, brain/HEARTBEAT.md, brain/INTERACTION_PROTOCOL.md
**Steps:**
1. Read brain/SOUL.md (identity check)
2. Read brain/STATE.md (current operational state)
3. Read memory/ACTIVE_TASKS.md (pending work)
4. Read memory/SESSION_LOG.md (last 3 entries)
5. Check git status
6. Report heartbeat status to CC
7. Await orders
**Success Criteria:** Bravo is oriented, CC knows system status
**Executions:** 0 | **Success Rate:** N/A (new SOP)
**Last Executed:** N/A

### SOP-004: Session End Protocol (Self-Heal + Sync)
**Category:** admin
**Status:** `[VALIDATED]` — Core protocol, always executes
**Trigger:** Session ending, /self-heal command
**Prerequisites:** brain/INTERACTION_PROTOCOL.md (Section 8)
**Steps:**
1. Scan for junk files in project root (*.js, *.txt, *.log, debug dumps)
2. Check for uncommitted changes (git status)
3. Update memory/ACTIVE_TASKS.md (mark completed, flag blocked)
4. Append to memory/SESSION_LOG.md
5. Extract new patterns → memory/PATTERNS.md (tag `[PROBATIONARY]` if new)
6. Extract new mistakes → memory/MISTAKES.md
7. Generate Reflexion entries for any failed tasks → memory/SELF_REFLECTIONS.md
8. Update brain/STATE.md with final state
9. Supabase sync: update agent_state, insert session_logs, flush agent_traces, insert new memories
10. Git commit: stage brain/ + memory/ → `bravo: sync — session YYYY-MM-DD`
11. Ask CC if ready to push to remote
12. Compress SESSION_LOG if > 200 lines
13. State to CC: "Memory synced. [X] files updated, [Y] traces logged, [Z] new learnings captured."
**Success Criteria:** Workspace clean, memory updated, state current, Supabase synced, git committed
**Executions:** 2 | **Success Rate:** 100%
**Last Executed:** 2026-02-28

### SOP-005: MCP Tool Routing (Query → Tool → Response)
**Category:** automation
**Status:** `[PROBATIONARY]` — New SOP, 2026-03-02
**Trigger:** ANY user query that can be answered by an MCP tool
**Prerequisites:** MCP servers running, credentials valid
**Steps:**
1. Parse user query — identify the TOPIC (n8n, social media, database, web, docs, memory)
2. Map topic to MCP server using this table:
   - n8n/workflows/automations → `n8n-mcp` → `search_workflows`, `get_workflow_details`, `execute_workflow`
   - Social media/posts/scheduling → `Late` → `posts_list`, `posts_create`, `accounts_list`, `posts_cross_post`
   - Database/SQL/tables → `Supabase` → `execute_sql`, `list_tables`, `apply_migration`
   - Web browsing/scraping → `Playwright` → `browser_navigate`, `browser_snapshot`
   - Library docs/code examples → `Context7` → `resolve-library-id`, `query-docs`
   - Knowledge/memory → `Memory` → `search_nodes`, `create_entities`
   - Payments/Stripe → `Stripe` → (see Stripe MCP tools)
3. Call the MCP tool IMMEDIATELY — do not describe what you would do
4. Return the REAL DATA from the tool response to the user
5. If the tool fails, report the error and suggest a fix — do NOT create workaround scripts
**Success Criteria:** User gets real data from the actual tool, not a description of what could be done
**Executions:** 0 | **Success Rate:** N/A
**Last Executed:** N/A

### SOP-006: N8N Workflow Management
**Category:** automation
**Status:** `[PROBATIONARY]` — New SOP, 2026-03-02
**Trigger:** CC asks to list, search, execute, or manage n8n workflows
**Prerequisites:** `skills/n8n-mcp-integration/SKILL.md`, N8N_API_KEY in .env.agents
**Steps:**
1. Call `search_workflows` to list/search (use `limit=200` for full list, `query="..."` for search)
2. For details: call `get_workflow_details(workflowId="...")` — ALWAYS before executing
3. For execution: call `execute_workflow(workflowId="...", inputs={...})` with proper input schema
4. For REST API fallback: use `curl -H "X-N8N-API-KEY: $N8N_API_KEY" https://n8n.srv993801.hstgr.cloud/api/v1/...`
5. Report results clearly — workflow name, status, node count, trigger type
**Success Criteria:** Workflows listed/executed correctly, real data returned
**Executions:** 0 | **Success Rate:** N/A
**Last Executed:** N/A

## SOP Promotion Pipeline

*Patterns are promoted to SOPs after 3+ executions with consistent steps.*
*SOPs start as `[PROBATIONARY]` → promoted to `[VALIDATED]` after 3 successful sessions → `[UNDER_REVIEW]` if errors occur.*

| Candidate Pattern | Observations | Status | Next Action |
|-------------------|-------------|--------|-------------|
| Playwright research → brief synthesis | 0 | Watching | Need 3 observations |
| Git branch → PR → Vercel preview | 1 | Watching | Need 2 more observations |
| Client onboarding flow | 0 | Template exists | Needs first execution |
| n8n workflow creation | 0 | Template exists | Needs first execution |
| Self-evolution file update cycle | 1 | Watching | Research → Apply to files → DB sync → Git |

## Automatic SOP Detection Rules

When the heartbeat (Step 6: Growth Check) detects:
- 3+ task completions with similar steps → auto-create `[PROBATIONARY]` SOP stub
- A `[PROBATIONARY]` SOP used successfully in 3+ sessions → promote to `[VALIDATED]`
- A SOP that causes errors → demote to `[UNDER_REVIEW]`, flag for CC
- A SOP not used in 30+ days → flag for archival consideration

## Retired SOPs

*SOPs that are no longer relevant. Kept for reference.*
