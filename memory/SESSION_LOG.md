### 2026-03-06 — Business-Empire-Agent (Claude Code / Opus 4.6) — Telegram V7.2 + App Registry + Cleanup
**Goal:** Fix broken Telegram bridge, create cross-repo app routing, clean workspace bloat.
**Done:**
- **Telegram Bridge V7.2**: Fixed 3 root causes — positional arg conflict, shell:true parsing, yargs multi-value flag. Now spawns node.exe directly with shell:false, repeats --allowed-mcp-server-names per server.
- **App Registry**: Created `brain/APP_REGISTRY.md` with 8 apps (paths, GitHub URLs, Supabase IDs, stacks). Added Rule 6 to CLAUDE.md, GEMINI.md, ANTIGRAVITY.md.
- **Routing Headers**: Added to 3 APPS_CONTEXT files (OASIS, PropFlow, Nostalgic).
- **Cleanup**: Deleted junk (out.json, output.txt, tmp/, .playwright-mcp/). Archived 10 obsolete scripts to scripts/archive/.
- **SESSION_LOG.md**: Archived Feb sessions to ARCHIVES/, removed UTF-16 corruption.
- **CAPABILITIES.md**: Added app registry section (8 external repos).
**Stats:** 1 bridge fixed (V7.2), 1 registry created, 15+ files updated, 10 scripts archived, session log compressed.

### 2026-03-04 — Business-Empire-Agent (Gemini CLI / Bravo V5.5) — Native SDKs & Video Elite
**Goal:** Replace broken MCPs with Python SDKs, process raw footage into high-engagement content, and set Thursday's blitz plan.
**Done:**
- **Native SDK Tools**: Built scripts/stripe_tool.py and scripts/supabase_tool.py. Universal access to all 6 accounts/projects verified.
- **Elite Video Pipeline**: Processed IMG_0450.MP4. Created word-level "pop" caption engine. Added contextual emoji FX.
- **Latency Fix**: Wrote scripts/fix_srt_latency.py to shift timestamps back by 800ms for perfect sync.
- **System Sync**: Updated brain/STATE.md and memory/ACTIVE_TASKS.md for Thursday's Revenue Blitz.
**Architecture Changes:**
- Innovative Visuals: FFmpeg drawtext logic implemented for keyword-based emoji overlays.
- Short-Form Standards: High-impact yellow/black bold captions established as the new default skill.
**Stats:** 2 new SDK tools, 1 elite video export, 3 file syncs, 1 high-accountability plan set.

### 2026-03-04 — Business-Empire-Agent (Gemini CLI / Bravo V5.5) — Native SDK Deployment
**Goal:** Replace broken Stripe/Supabase MCP servers with universal Python SDK tools.
**Done:**
- **Stripe SDK**: Built scripts/stripe_tool.py. Supports multi-account access (OASIS, PropFlow, Nostalgic) via Org Key + Stripe-Context header. Verified LIVE status for all 3 brands.
- **Supabase SDK**: Built scripts/supabase_tool.py. Supports 3 projects (Bravo, OASIS, Nostalgic) via direct Python SDK. Verified connectivity for all 3.
- **Workflow Audit**: Verified 6/6 MCP servers (n8n, Late, Playwright, Context7, Memory, Sequential Thinking) are operational on Windows via .cmd wrappers.
- **Active Tasks**: Updated Wednesday goals. SDK tools marked as DONE.
**Architecture Changes:**
- Native SDK tools (Python) replace unreliable MCP bridge for core finance/database operations.
**Stats:** 2 new SDK tools, 6 accounts verified, brain/memory files synced.

### 2026-03-02 (Session 10) — Business-Empire-Agent (Antigravity / Gemini) — MCP Wrapper Fix & Infrastructure Lock-in
**Goal:** Fix n8n and Late MCP servers that fail due to env var injection issue. Final infrastructure stabilization.
**Done:**
- **Root cause identified:** Antigravity IDE does NOT inject `env` block variables from JSON configs into spawned subprocesses on Windows.
- **Fix deployed:** Created `scripts/n8n-mcp-wrapper.cmd` and `scripts/late-mcp-wrapper.cmd` that `set` env vars before launching MCP processes.
- **Configs updated:** Both `.gemini/settings.json` and `.vscode/mcp.json` now use `cmd /c wrapper.cmd` pattern.
- **Stripe & Supabase removed:** Deleted from MCP store (download errors). Will reconfigure manually later.
- **Verified:** N8N API returns 44 workflows. Late wrapper starts successfully. 6/6 active servers configured correctly.
**Stats:** 2 wrapper scripts created, 2 MCP configs rewritten, 5 brain/memory files updated.

### 2026-03-02 (Session 2) — Business-Empire-Agent (Claude Code / Opus 4.6) — Telegram Fix + Lead Outreach
**Goal:** Fix Telegram bot not responding + research local leads + draft outreach emails.
**Done:**
- Fixed `telegram_agent.js`: Updated to V5.5 query-first routing, removed dead ref, lighter autonomous prompt.
- Restarted bot — now running. Researched 12 local Collingwood businesses via Playwright.
- Drafted 6 outreach emails (Cedarwood Wellness, Active Life, Affordable Comfort HVAC, Georgian Shores Dental, Northwood Club, Vortex Wellness).
**Stats:** 5 files updated, 1 bot restarted, 12 leads researched, 6 emails drafted.

### 2026-03-02 (Session 1) — Business-Empire-Agent (Claude Code / Opus 4.6) — MCP Infrastructure Fix
**Goal:** Fix Gemini CLI not routing queries to MCP tools + n8n MCP returning 0 workflows.
**Done:**
- **Root cause:** Gemini CLI dumping brain state instead of answering queries. N8n native endpoint only exposes MCP-trigger workflows.
- **GEMINI.md rewritten:** Query-first routing. Boot sequence internal-only.
- **N8N MCP switched:** Community `n8n-mcp` package (REST API, 44 workflows). New API key deployed.
- **All 4 MCP configs synced.** ROUTING_MAP.md enhanced. 2 SOPs + 2 patterns added. mcp-operations skill created.
**Stats:** 10+ files updated, 2 new SOPs, 2 new patterns, 4 configs synced, 1 new skill.

- Security cleanup: deleted test_mcp.js (hardcoded token), redacted exposed tokens.
- Weekly plan built (outreach blitz Tue/Thu, content Wed/Fri).
**Stats:** 4 tables created, 3 functions deployed, 12+ files modified, 2 tokens redacted.
