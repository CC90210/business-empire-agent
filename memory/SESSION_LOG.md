### 2026-02-28 â€” Business-Empire-Agent (Anti-Gravity / Gemini 1.5 Flash) - V5.2 Total Access Transition
**Goal:** Transition to V5.2 "Total Access" architecture: Purge Ollama, optimize autonomous CLI routing, and unlock full repository capabilities via Telegram.
**Done:**
- **Purge Phase**: Fully removed Ollama/Llama references from `brain/CAPABILITIES.md`, `AGENT_CORE_DIRECTIVES.md`, and tech stack.
- **Bot Optimization**: Refactored `telegram_agent.js` to include `executeClaude` and `executeGemini` functions with autonomous "System Directive" wrapping.
- **Routing logic**: Implemented `--approval-mode yolo` for Gemini and `--dangerously-skip-permissions` for Claude in the headless bridge.
- **Identity Upgrade**: Updated `brain/SOUL.md` and `AGENT_CORE_DIRECTIVES.md` to V5.2 (Total Access).
- **Clean up**: Removed redundant `diagnostic.js` from root.
**Architecture Changes:**
- System is now a "Total Access" autonomous engine with secret context-wrapping on every Telegram command. All 37 skills and 16 commands are now proactively used by the bridge agents.
**Stats:** 1 obsolete model purged, 1 script refactored, 3 brain files updated, 1 root file deleted.
**Next:** Test the V5.2 bridge with a complex multi-file task via Telegram.

- Full codebase audit (all 76+ files read and analyzed)
- Created `brain/` directory with 7 core files: SOUL.md, USER.md, HEARTBEAT.md, BRAIN_LOOP.md, CAPABILITIES.md, GROWTH.md, STATE.md
- Created 3 new memory files: LONG_TERM.md (confidence-scored facts), SELF_REFLECTIONS.md, SOP_LIBRARY.md
- Created 6 new skills: self-healing (5-dimension, 4-tier), sop-breakdown, memory-management (MemoryBox), growth-engine, heartbeat, sequential-reasoning
- Created `database/001_bravo_agent_schema.sql` â€” 10 tables, helper functions, RLS policies for Supabase persistence
- Updated AGENT_CORE_DIRECTIVES.md to V5.0 (brain-first boot, 11 sections)
- Updated CLAUDE.md with brain-first boot sequence
- Updated ANTIGRAVITY.md and BLACKBOX.md entry points
- Updated auto-memory MEMORY.md
**Architecture Changes:**
- Brain-first loading: SOUL.md loaded FIRST in every reasoning cycle
- 10-step Brain Loop protocol (ORIENT â†’ RECALL â†’ ASSESS â†’ PLAN â†’ VERIFY â†’ EXECUTE â†’ REFLECT â†’ STORE â†’ EVOLVE â†’ HEAL)
- Confidence-scored memory (0.0-1.0 with time decay)
- 5-dimension self-healing (memory, context, skill, infrastructure, relationship)
- SOP auto-generation from repeated patterns (3+ executions)
- Growth engine tracking capability frontier
- Heartbeat for session-start proactive monitoring
- Dual storage: files (source of truth) + Supabase (queryable index)
**Stats:** V4â†’V5 upgrade. 7 new brain files, 3 new memory files, 6 new skills, 1 SQL migration, 4 updated entry points. Total: 37 skills, 12 agents, 16 commands.
**Blocked:** Supabase MCP token still not injected (SQL ready to apply when available)
**Next:** Apply Supabase migration, test heartbeat protocol, first content session with new architecture

### 2026-02-28 â€” Business-Empire-Agent (Anti-Gravity) - Self-Healing Phase
**Goal:** Diagnostic, Memory Optimization, and File Structuring after Social Output execution.
**Done:**
- Created `/commands/self-heal.md` as a strict end-of-session diagnostic protocol.
- Updated `AGENT_CORE_DIRECTIVES.md` to force execution of the self-heal process during the 'Session End' phase.
- Logged four new mistakes in `MISTAKES.md` covering monkey patching flaws, character limit violations, Powershell UTF encoding snags, and `node -e` parsing chaos.
- Updated `PATTERNS.md` with explicit Anti-Patterns forbidding the creation of unauthorized bypass scripts to preserve the strict use of verified MCP configurations.
**Next:** Validate self-healing scripts continuously to shrink prompt bloat.

- Patched Late MCP Pydantic models (profileId dictâ†’str) in uv cache
- Fixed __future__ import ordering that broke Late server boot
**Issues:**
- Late API profileId schema mismatch (dict vs str) â€” patched
- X post rejected for length (Error 207) â€” rewrote under 280 chars
- __future__ import pushed to line 2 by patch â€” fixed
