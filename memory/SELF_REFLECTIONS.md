# SELF-REFLECTIONS — Agent Self-Assessment Log

> Bravo reflects after complex tasks, failures, and milestones.
> Quality gate: Only log reflections that are specific, evidence-based, novel, and useful.

## Reflection Format

## Reflections

### 2026-02-27 — First Live Social Media Posts
**What happened:** Published first LinkedIn + X posts via Late API. X post was rejected initially for exceeding 280 chars.
**What I learned:** Platform character limits must be validated BEFORE calling the API. The Late MCP doesn't validate for you.
**What I'd do differently:** Build character counting into the content creation flow, not as an afterthought.
**Confidence in lesson:** 0.95

### 2026-02-27 — Pydantic Monkey-Patching Failure
**What happened:** Tried to fix Late MCP by prepending code to a Python file. Broke __future__ imports.
**What I learned:** Never modify line 1 of Python files without checking for __future__ imports. Monkey-patching is fragile.
**What I'd do differently:** Read the target file first. Test the patch in isolation before applying.
**Confidence in lesson:** 0.95

### 2026-02-28 — Architecture Evolution (V4 → V5)
**What happened:** Researched OpenClaw architecture and designed enhanced brain/ directory system.
**What I learned:** File-based agent identity (SOUL.md) loaded at every reasoning cycle creates more consistent behavior than scattered directives. The heartbeat pattern enables proactive behavior without daemon mode.
**What I'd do differently:** Should have designed the brain/ architecture from V1 instead of retrofitting.
**Confidence in lesson:** 0.85

### 2026-03-03 — Full System Audit Reveals Systemic Integrity Failures
**What happened:** Session 12 audit discovered 15+ stale cross-references, incorrect capability counts (3 mismatches), and lingering deprecated files. All caused by structural changes made without scanning for downstream effects.
**What I learned:** Every bug in this session shared 1 of 3 root causes: (1) No referential integrity checking after file changes, (2) No formal deprecation lifecycle for superseded files, (3) No automated count verification. These aren't edge cases — they're systemic gaps in the self-healing protocol.
**What I'd do differently:** Built 5 prevention protocols: mandatory referential integrity scan in BRAIN_LOOP Step 10 and /commit workflow, file deprecation protocol in INTERACTION_PROTOCOL, capability count verification in /commit, and 3 new anti-patterns in PATTERNS.md. The system now won't let me commit without scanning for broken refs.
**Confidence in lesson:** 0.98

### 2026-03-03 — Self-Improvement Must Be Proactive, Not Reactive
**What happened:** The agent had been recording mistakes and patterns for weeks but never analyzed them for SYSTEMIC themes. It took CC requesting a "third perspective" review to discover that 7+ mistakes all shared the same root cause (no referential integrity).
**What I learned:** Individual mistake logging is necessary but insufficient. The agent must periodically perform ROOT CAUSE CLUSTERING — looking across all mistakes to find shared systemic patterns. This is the difference between fixing symptoms and curing diseases.
**What I'd do differently:** Add a "Meta-Analysis" check to the /monthly-audit that clusters recent mistakes by root cause category (e.g., "integrity", "validation", "external drift") and creates countermeasures for the top 3 clusters.
**Confidence in lesson:** 0.92
