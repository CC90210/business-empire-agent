Execute a "Garbage Collection" rollover to optimize the memory system so it never exceeds contextual limits.

Follow this process exactly:

1. Read `memory/SESSION_LOG.md` and `memory/MISTAKES.md`.
2. Analyze the size: If either file is approaching or exceeding 400-500 lines, they need condensation.
3. Extract fundamental, overarching principles, proven strategies, and universal lessons out of the resolved mistakes and daily logs.
4. Append these extracted, timeless lessons into `memory/PATTERNS.md` (e.g., specific Edge runtime bug fixes or Next.js state patterns).
5. Compile the raw historical logs from `SESSION_LOG.md` into a dense, compressed chronological summary and append it to `memory/ARCHIVES/[Month_Year]_Archive.md`.
6. Empty the outdated entries from `SESSION_LOG.md` and `MISTAKES.md` respectively, keeping only the most recent 14 days of data to preserve a fast, relevant context window.
7. Report to CC what was condensed, what was archived, and confirm that the active memory is clean.
