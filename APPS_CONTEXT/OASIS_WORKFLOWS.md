## How This File Works

The Business Empire Agent updates this file automatically when:
- A new n8n workflow is created
- An existing workflow is modified
- A workflow is activated or deactivated
- A workflow fails repeatedly (flagged for review)

Each entry links to the workflow's documentation in the relevant project's `docs/workflows/` directory.
