# AI Training — Teaching Businesses to Use AI

## Project Overview

CC teaches small-to-medium business owners how to understand, implement, and leverage AI automation in their operations. This includes crash courses, workshops, one-on-one consulting, and eventually scalable online courses.

## Service Tiers

1. **Crash Course** — 1-2 hour workshop on AI fundamentals for business owners
2. **Implementation Workshop** — Hands-on session building their first automation
3. **1-on-1 Consulting** — Custom AI strategy and implementation guidance
4. **Online Course** — Self-paced curriculum (future product)

## Curriculum Topics

- What AI actually is (demystified, no jargon)
- How APIs work (explained for non-technical people)
- HTTP requests and webhooks (the pipes that connect everything)
- Setting up simple automations (Zapier/Make as gateway, n8n for serious work)
- AI chatbots for customer service
- Voice AI for phone handling
- Email automation and smart responses
- Lead capture and CRM automation
- ROI calculation — how to measure automation success
- Future of AI and what business owners need to prepare for

## Teaching Philosophy

- Start with the WHY (business impact) before the HOW (technical)
- Use real examples from actual OASIS AI client work
- Make it tangible — show before/after comparisons
- No one leaves without something they can implement tomorrow
- Build confidence, not dependency — teach them to think in automation

## Content Format

- Slide decks (Google Slides / PowerPoint)
- Video walkthroughs (screen recordings)
- Written guides with screenshots
- Hands-on exercises with real tools
- Case studies from OASIS AI clients (anonymized)
