# Nostalgic Requests — Performer Song Request Platform

## Project Overview

Nostalgic Requests is a premium song request and payment platform for live music performers (DJs, live musicians, karaoke hosts). Audience members scan a QR code, request songs, pay instantly, and performers manage a real-time queue.

## How It Works

1. Performer creates an event → Gets unique QR code
2. Audience scans QR → Beautiful mobile portal opens
3. Audience searches any song (iTunes/Spotify integration) → Selects request tier
4. Pays via Apple Pay / Google Pay → Instant checkout via Stripe
5. Performer sees request in real-time dashboard → Manages queue live
6. SMS notification → "Your song is up next!" sent to requester
7. Lead captured → Phone + email stored for future marketing

## Revenue Model

- **Platform fee:** 5% of each transaction (Nostalgic Requests' cut)
- **Stripe fees:** 2.9% + $0.30 (charged separately by Stripe)
- **Performers set their own prices** (we provide suggested defaults)
