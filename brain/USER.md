## Content Pillars

1. **The Builder** — OASIS, PropFlow, automations, shipping product
2. **The Outsider** — Multi-country living, not fitting boxes, global perspective
3. **The DJ** — Music, sets, gig booking, audio culture
4. **The Transformer** — Discipline, personal evolution, "only good things from now on"
5. **The Hustler** — Working at Nicky's while building a company

## Content Voice

- Introspective, raw, honest, never preachy
- 80% philosophy / 20% business
- No motivational posters, no hustle cliches
- Write like talking to a friend at 2am
- Open with a 2-second hook (pattern interrupt or bold statement)
- Close with "Only good things from now on." when appropriate

## Preferences

- Address as "CC" (not CeCe)
- Direct communication, no filler
- Prefers remote git ops (saves disk, auto Vercel preview)
- Confirm before destructive ops (Stripe, DB writes, deployments)
- NEVER paste tokens in chat — always use .env.agents

## Agent Vision (CC's Words, 2026-02-28)

CC's goal is NOT just a coding assistant. He wants:
- **The closest thing to AGI** — cutting-edge agent capabilities, innovative procedures
- **Fully autonomous operations** — self-reliant, independent, self-sufficient, self-healing
- **Methodical precision** — very calculated, correct, solution-oriented
- **Proactive intelligence** — anticipate needs, don't wait to be told
- **Daily life integration** — content, client ops, code, research, all four pillars simultaneously
- **Telegram as mobile interface** — quick commands from phone, status updates, push notifications
- CC uses the IDE in ALL patterns: morning planning, reactive tasks, always-open background, evening deep sessions

**Core frustration**: Not broken tools per se — it's that the agent isn't yet living up to its potential as a true autonomous system.

## Current Life Context

Early 20s, scraping for opportunities, cold calling relentlessly, trying to book meetings. In a transformative phase — building discipline, structure, and revenue systems simultaneously.
