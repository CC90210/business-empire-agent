# GROWTH — Self-Learning & Evolution Tracker

> Bravo grows smarter with every session. This file tracks capability expansion, learning milestones, and evolution over time.

## Capability Frontier

*What Bravo can do today that it couldn't before. Updated after significant new capabilities.*

| Date | Capability Acquired | Confidence | Evidence |
|------|-------------------|------------|----------|
| 2026-02-27 | Social media posting via Late MCP (8 platforms) | 0.85 | First successful LinkedIn + X posts |
| 2026-02-27 | Multi-agent architecture (3-tier routing) | 0.90 | Claude Code + Anti-Gravity + Blackbox operational |
| 2026-02-27 | Pydantic error diagnosis & uv cache patching | 0.80 | Fixed profileId dict→str in Late MCP |
| 2026-02-28 | Self-healing diagnostics (session-end protocol) | 0.85 | self-heal.md command created and tested |
| 2026-02-28 | OpenClaw-enhanced brain architecture (V5.0) | 0.90 | brain/ directory, 10-step loop, heartbeat |
| 2026-02-28 | Gemini CLI Integration (v0.31.0) | 0.95 | Installed `@google/gemini-cli` globally |

## Learning Velocity

*Track how fast Bravo is acquiring new capabilities.*

- **Sessions to date:** 5
- **Capabilities acquired:** 6
- **Mistakes logged:** 7 (all with prevention strategies)
- **Patterns established:** 4 effective + 4 anti-patterns
- **SOPs created:** 0 (tracking begins now)

## Evolution Goals

### Short-Term (Next 5 Sessions)
- [ ] First successful Supabase query via MCP
- [ ] First n8n workflow created via MCP
- [ ] First SOP auto-generated from repeated task
- [ ] Achieve 90%+ task completion rate
- [ ] Build first competitive analysis via Playwright

### Medium-Term (Next 30 Days)
- [ ] 10+ SOPs in SOP_LIBRARY.md
- [ ] Memory confidence scoring operational
- [ ] Self-healing detects and fixes 3+ issue types autonomously
- [ ] Content creation pipeline fully automated (ideation → writing → posting)
- [ ] First headless execution via n8n → Telegram → CLI

### Long-Term (90 Days)
- [ ] Fully autonomous daily operations (heartbeat handles routine)
- [ ] 50+ capabilities in frontier
- [ ] Self-learning loop operational (pattern → SOP → skill)
- [ ] Cross-session context maintained via Supabase
- [ ] CC can issue single commands that trigger full workflows

## Pattern-to-SOP Pipeline

*When a pattern is used 3+ times, it should become an SOP.*

| Pattern | Usage Count | SOP Status |
|---------|------------|------------|
| Late API posting flow | 2 | Watching (1 more → SOP) |
| Git branch → PR → Vercel preview | 1 | Watching |
| Playwright research → brief synthesis | 0 | Not started |

## Self-Assessment Triggers

Bravo should self-assess when:
1. A task type is attempted for the 3rd time (pattern extraction opportunity)
2. A new mistake is logged (prevention strategy needed)
3. A session exceeds 10 tool calls without resolution (complexity assessment)
4. CC expresses frustration or redirects (communication calibration)
5. Monthly (via /monthly-audit command)
