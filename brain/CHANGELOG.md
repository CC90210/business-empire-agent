## Changelog

### 2026-03-01 — AGENT_CORE_DIRECTIVES.md — UPDATE (V5.4 → V5.5)
**Tier:** SEMI-MUTABLE (approved by CC during session)
**What changed:** Added Interaction Protocol to boot sequence, self-evolution section, interaction governance section, updated file structure with mutability tags
**Why:** CC directed full system upgrade to self-evolving architecture
**Confidence:** 0.95

### 2026-03-01 — brain/INTERACTION_PROTOCOL.md — CREATE
**Tier:** SEMI-MUTABLE (new file, approved by CC)
**What changed:** Created master governance protocol for all agent interactions
**Why:** No interaction governance existed. Architecture audit identified this as critical gap.
**Confidence:** 0.92

### 2026-03-01 — brain/BRAIN_LOOP.md — UPDATE
**Tier:** SEMI-MUTABLE (approved by CC during session)
**What changed:** Added LATS multi-hypothesis generation (Step 4), Reflexion protocol (Step 7), dual-write to Supabase (Step 8), Voyager skill compositionality (Step 9), activation-scored retrieval (Step 2), failure recovery protocol
**Why:** Research into LATS, Reflexion, Voyager revealed superior reasoning patterns
**Confidence:** 0.90

### 2026-03-01 — brain/HEARTBEAT.md — UPDATE
**Tier:** GOVERNED MUTABLE
**What changed:** Added OpenClaw merge window, Supabase state sync check, duplicate suppression, enhanced session-end protocol with 13 steps, probationary item promotion checks
**Why:** OpenClaw architecture research revealed superior heartbeat patterns
**Confidence:** 0.88

### 2026-03-01 — brain/GROWTH.md — UPDATE
**Tier:** GOVERNED MUTABLE
**What changed:** Replaced flat skill list with Voyager-style tracked table (uses/status/composites), added compositionality section, expanded capability frontier to table format, added growth metrics
**Why:** Voyager research showed compositional skill libraries compound capability faster
**Confidence:** 0.90

### 2026-03-01 — memory/SOP_LIBRARY.md — UPDATE
**Tier:** GOVERNED MUTABLE
**What changed:** Added probationary validation system, activation scoring, prerequisite tracking, automatic SOP detection rules, enhanced SOP-004 with Supabase sync steps
**Why:** Self-evolving architecture requires formalized SOP lifecycle management
**Confidence:** 0.88

### 2026-03-01 — memory/PATTERNS.md — UPDATE
**Tier:** FREELY MUTABLE
**What changed:** Added validation status tags ([VALIDATED]/[PROBATIONARY]), session counts, last-used dates, two new patterns (Multi-Hypothesis, Reflexion on Failure)
**Why:** Patterns need lifecycle tracking to support probationary system
**Confidence:** 0.92

### 2026-03-01 — database/002_interaction_traces_schema.sql — CREATE
**Tier:** GOVERNED MUTABLE
**What changed:** Added 4 tables (agent_traces, self_modification_log, performance_metrics, skill_activation) + 3 helper functions
**Why:** Enable structured observability and self-evolution tracking
**Confidence:** 0.90

### 2026-03-01 — brain/STATE.md — UPDATE
**Tier:** EPHEMERAL
**What changed:** Updated to V5.5, new confidence level, updated goals and system health
**Why:** Standard session-end state update
**Confidence:** 0.95
