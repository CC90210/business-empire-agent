description: Self-learning and evolution system. Tracks capability expansion, extracts patterns from experience, promotes patterns to SOPs, identifies skill gaps, and produces evolution reports. Triggers after complex tasks, failures, and monthly audits.

# Growth Engine — Self-Learning System

## Overview

Bravo doesn't just execute — it learns. The Growth Engine tracks what Bravo can do, identifies what it should learn next, and systematically expands capabilities over time.

## Growth Cycle

```
EXPERIENCE → REFLECT → EXTRACT → STORE → APPLY → GROW
     ↑                                              |
     └──────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### 1. EXPERIENCE
Every task execution generates experience data:
- Task type and complexity
- Tools and skills used
- Outcome (success/partial/failure)
- Time taken
- Errors encountered
- CC's feedback (explicit or implicit)

### 2. REFLECT
After significant tasks (Brain Loop Step 7), assess:
- What went well? Why?
- What failed? Root cause?
- Was there a more efficient approach?
- Did I use the right tools?
- Would CC be satisfied with the quality?

### 3. EXTRACT
Derive actionable insights:
- **New Pattern:** A repeatable approach that works (→ PATTERNS.md)
- **New Mistake:** An error to never repeat (→ MISTAKES.md)
- **New Capability:** Something Bravo can now do (→ brain/GROWTH.md)
- **New SOP Candidate:** A process done 3+ times (→ SOP_LIBRARY.md)
- **Skill Gap:** A task that failed due to missing capability

### 4. STORE
Store with appropriate confidence scores:
- Patterns: minimum 0.7 confidence (2+ observations)
- Mistakes: minimum 0.9 confidence (verified root cause)
- Capabilities: minimum 0.8 confidence (successfully executed)
- SOP candidates: tracked in pattern-to-SOP pipeline

### 5. APPLY
Use stored knowledge in future tasks:
- Brain Loop Step 2 (RECALL) searches all memory stores
- Brain Loop Step 5 (VERIFY) checks against known patterns/mistakes
- SOP execution follows stored procedures

### 6. GROW
Expand the capability frontier:
- New tools mastered
- New task types completed successfully
- New integrations established
- Higher success rates on existing capabilities

## Capability Categories

| Category | Examples |
|----------|----------|
| **Communication** | Social posting, content writing, email drafting |
| **Development** | Bug fixing, feature building, code review, testing |
| **Research** | Market analysis, competitive intelligence, trend spotting |
| **Automation** | n8n workflows, cron jobs, triggered pipelines |
| **Operations** | Client onboarding, invoicing, deployment |
| **Analysis** | Data analysis, performance profiling, SEO audit |
| **Creative** | Visual design, video editing, brand content |
| **Strategic** | Business planning, pricing strategy, growth hacking |

## Skill Gap Detection

When a task fails or is routed away because Bravo lacks capability:

1. Log the gap: "Could not [action] because [reason]"
2. Research: Is there a skill, tool, or MCP that could fill this gap?
3. Propose: Suggest to CC how to acquire the capability
4. Track: Add to "Evolution Goals" in brain/GROWTH.md

## Evolution Reports

### Weekly Summary (Auto-generated if 5+ sessions)
```
BRAVO WEEKLY EVOLUTION REPORT
Period: [date range]
Sessions: [count]
Tasks Completed: [count] | Success Rate: [%]
New Capabilities: [list]
Mistakes Prevented: [count] (from learned patterns)
SOPs Created: [count]
Top Growth Area: [category]
Biggest Challenge: [description]
```

### Monthly Report (Via /monthly-audit command)
- Full capability frontier review
- Confidence score decay processing
- SOP success rate analysis
- Skill gap inventory
- Growth velocity trends
- Recommendations for CC

## Self-Learning Triggers

| Trigger | Action |
|---------|--------|
| Task completed successfully | Log capability if new |
| Task failed | Log mistake, identify gap |
| Same task done 3rd time | Draft SOP candidate |
| CC provides feedback | Calibrate communication/approach |
| Monthly audit | Full growth review |
| New MCP/tool added | Log new capability, test integration |
| Pattern confidence > 0.9 | Promote to SOP if actionable |
