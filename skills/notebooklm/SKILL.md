# NotebookLM Skill

Use Google NotebookLM as an "on-site RAG" for deep research, source-grounded chat, and multi-format content generation (audio, video, reports).

## When to Activate
- Deep research on a complex topic with many sources.
- Creating a "Source-to-Podcast" or "Source-to-Video" pipeline.
- Generating study guides, quizzes, flashcards, or briefing docs from files.
- Managing an "External Brain" with sources from web, files, YouTube, and Drive.

## Core Tool: notebooklm
All operations run via `scripts/notebooklm_tool.py`.

### Essential Commands
- `login`: First-time setup (requires manual browser login).
- `create <title>`: Start a new notebook.
- `use <id>`: Set the active notebook.
- `source add <content>`: Add a URL, file, or YouTube video.
- `source add-research <query> --mode deep --import-all`: AI-powered research.
- `generate <audio|video|report|quiz|flashcards>`: Create artifacts.
- `download <type> <path>`: Save artifacts locally.
- `ask <question>`: Chat with the sources.

## Strategic Workflows

### 1. The Research-to-Artifact Cascade
1. Create and `use` a new notebook.
2. Add initial seed sources (URLs, PDFs).
3. Run `source add-research` to broaden the context.
4. `generate audio --format debate --wait` for a high-level overview.
5. `generate report --format study-guide` for a structured breakdown.
6. `download` both for review.

### 2. The Video Explainer Pipeline
1. Add a technical document as a source.
2. Run `generate video --style classic --wait`.
3. Download the `.mp4` and pass to `video-editor` agent if further editing is needed.

### 3. The Long-Term Research Assistant
1. Use one notebook as a "Knowledge Base" for a specific brand (OASIS, PropFlow).
2. Constantly add new competitor updates, market reports, and customer feedback.
3. Use `ask` to query across all historical sources.

## Principles
- **Grounding**: Always verify generated claims against the sources (use `source fulltext` if needed).
- **Asynchronicity**: Generation takes time. Use `artifact wait <id>` or inform the user it's running in the background.
- **Context Management**: NotebookLM handles the "heavy lifting" of RAG, allowing the main agent context to stay clean.

## Prerequisites
- `notebooklm-py` installed in `.venv`.
- Manual `notebooklm login` performed once.
- `.env.agents` has any required Google credentials (though `storage_state.json` handles most).
