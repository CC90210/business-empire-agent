description: Debug a problem systematically — reproduce, diagnose, fix, verify

// turbo-all

## Steps

1. **Understand the problem** — Ask CC or read the error message. What's expected vs. actual behavior?

2. **Check known issues** — Read `memory/MISTAKES.md` and `memory/PATTERNS.md` for similar past bugs.

3. **Reproduce** — Run the failing command or navigate to the failing page. Capture the exact error.

4. **Diagnose** — Use the systematic debugging skill:
   - Read the relevant source files
   - Check logs (terminal output, browser console via Playwright)
   - Search for the error message in codebase with `grep_search`
   - Generate 2-3 hypotheses for root cause

5. **Fix** — Implement the fix for the most likely hypothesis. Edit files directly.

6. **Verify** — Re-run the failing command/test to confirm the fix works.

7. **Document** — If this was a non-obvious bug:
   - Add pattern to `memory/PATTERNS.md` (tag `[PROBATIONARY]`)
   - Add to `memory/MISTAKES.md` if it was a mistake we should avoid repeating

8. Report: "Fixed: [description]. Root cause: [cause]. Verified: [how]."
